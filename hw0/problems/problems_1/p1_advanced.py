def manage_queue(operations):
    """
    Manage a queue system for a customer service desk.

    The queue is represented as a list where the first element is the first person in line.
    Implement the following operations:
    - Enqueue: Add a person to the end of the queue.
    - Dequeue: Remove and return the name of the first person in line.
    - Remove Person: Given a person's name, remove them from the queue.
    - Jump the Queue: A person has a quick question and is allowed to jump to the front of the queue,
      but not in front of the very first person.

    Parameters:
    - operations (list): A list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is the operation
      (either "enqueue", "dequeue", "remove", or "jump") and the second element (if applicable) is the person's name.

    Returns:
    - list: The state of the queue after performing all the operations.

    Example:

    Input:
    [("enqueue", "Alice"), ("enqueue", "Bob"), ("enqueue", "Charlie"), ("dequeue",), ("jump", "Eve"), ("remove", "Bob")]

    Output:
    ["Eve", "Charlie"]
